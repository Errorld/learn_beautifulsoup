##encountered a problem when I want to derive the *name of a variable* from a *variable*
find a answer on Zhihu,which is:
> **no** method to do so
(original answer)[http://www.zhihu.com/question/20403362/answer/15050144]
'cause Python holds no such a useful function and implement no pre-processing.*I guse*
###also got something:
- global() gives a dict which contains{variableName, value}
but can't get the variableName with no clue
